My Web Development Journey


This is a project I've been sitting on for a while and finally found the proper inspiration to act on.

I tried a few times to learn how to build and deploy a website using the .NET framework, thinking it was the OG way and I would learn things. But after many hours and a lot of brain damage, I gave up.

I then searched YouTube looking for a code-along tutorial and finally found one for a portfolio using the React framework.
"F it," I said, and now we're here.

This is definitely not any work of quality, and anything that looks decent is probably stolen.

But it's mine, and I'm going to continue learning and building it for as long as I have any inspiration at all.
